## Key Recommendations Summary

### 1. Pricing Transformation
**Current:** 250 SAR setup + 25 SAR/month (3 SAR margin)  
**Proposed:** Tiered model with 49-199 SAR/month (14-66% margins)

| Tier | Monthly | Margin | Target Customer |
|------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Starter | 49 SAR | 14% | Solo entrepreneurs |
| Business ⭐ | 99 SAR | 49% | Small shops, clinics |
| Pro | 199 SAR | 66% | Growing businesses |

**Target:** 100 customers = 9,650 SAR MRR = 115,800 SAR/year

### 2. Immediate Legal Actions
1. Complete commercial registration (CR)
2. Register with SDAIA for PDPL compliance
3. Appoint Data Protection Officer
4. Implement consent collection flow
