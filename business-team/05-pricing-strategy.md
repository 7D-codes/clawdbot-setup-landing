## Pricing Psychology & Tactics

### 1. Decoy Effect
The Pro tier at 199 SAR makes Business at 99 SAR look like a bargain.

### 2. Charm Pricing
All prices end in 9 (49, 99, 199) - psychologically perceived as significantly lower.

### 3. Annual Anchoring
Annual prices shown with "2 months free" emphasize savings and improve cash flow.

### 4. Setup Fee Psychology
Setup fees serve multiple purposes:
- Filter out non-serious prospects
- Cover initial labor investment
- Create commitment/consistency
- Allow for promotional "waived setup fee" campaigns

### 5. Per-Message Limitations
Message limits create natural upgrade pressure:
- Starter: 500/month (tight for active businesses)
- Business: 2,000/month (comfortable for most)
- Pro: 10,000/month (effectively unlimited for small biz)
