# Fair Usage Policy (Customer-Facing)

**Last Updated:** January 2, 2025  
**Applies to:** All Clawdbot customers

---

## ماذا تعني "طلبات الذكاء الاصطناعي"؟ (What are "AI Requests"?)

**ببساطة:** كل مرة يرد فيها مساعدك الذكي على رسالة عميل، يُحتسب ذلك كـ **طلب واحد**.

**أمثلة:**
- ✅ عميل يسأل "كم سعر المنتج؟" → المساعد يرد = **1 طلب**
- ✅ عميل يحجز موعد → المساعد يؤكد = **1 طلب**
- ✅ المساعد يبحث في معلومات نشاطك = **1 طلب**
- ❌ إرسال رسالة عادية (بدون ذكاء اصطناعي) = **0 طلبات**

---

## What Are "AI Requests"?

Simply put: Every time your AI assistant responds to a customer message, that counts as **one request**.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Customer asks "What's your price?" → AI responds = **1 request**
- ✅ Customer books appointment → AI confirms = **1 request**
- ✅ AI searches your business info = **1 request**
- ❌ Sending regular message (no AI) = **0 requests**

---

## Monthly Limits by Plan

| Plan | Monthly AI Requests | Approx. Customer Messages* |
|------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **Basic** | 1,500 | ~1,000-1,200 |
| **Business** ⭐ | 4,000 | ~2,500-3,000 |
| **Pro** | Unlimited | Unlimited |

*Approximate because some messages require multiple AI lookups

---

## What Happens If I Exceed My Limit?

### Soft Limit (100% of quota)
- You'll receive an email notification
- Service continues with warning
- We'll suggest upgrading to a higher plan

### Hard Limit (120% of quota)
- AI responses will pause temporarily
- Your WhatsApp/Telegram still works for manual replies
- Service resumes on your next billing cycle
- Or you can upgrade immediately to restore service

### Pro Plan Exception
Pro users have unlimited requests under our Fair Use Policy (typical usage up to 25,000/month).

---

## How to Avoid Hitting Limits

### 1. Use Knowledge Base Efficiently
Train your AI with comprehensive FAQs so it answers in one response instead of multiple lookups.

### 2. Set Clear Business Hours
Use auto-responder outside hours instead of AI processing every message immediately.

### 3. Monitor Your Usage
Check your dashboard weekly to see your usage trend.

### 4. Upgrade Early
If you're consistently at 80%+ usage, upgrade before hitting limits.

---

## Upgrading Is Easy

Hitting your limit regularly? Upgrade anytime:

| Upgrade Path | New Monthly Cost | Extra Requests |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| Basic → Business | +70 SAR | +2,500 more |
| Business → Pro | +150 SAR | Unlimited |

Upgrades take effect immediately. Your quota resets on upgrade.

### Sudden Traffic Spikes
If you have a viral post or unexpected traffic:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do unused requests roll over?
**A:** No. Quotas reset monthly on your billing date. Use them or lose them.

### Q: Can I buy extra requests without upgrading?
**A:** Yes! Extra requests cost 0.05 SAR each (5 halalas). Contact support to add.

### Q: What counts as a "message" vs "request"?
**A:** A message is what your customer sends. A request is when our AI processes it. Most messages = 1 request, but complex questions might use 2-3.

### Q: How do I check my current usage?
**A:** Log into your dashboard at [dashboard.clawdbot.sa](https://dashboard.clawdbot.sa) or type "usage" to your AI assistant.

### Q: What happens at exactly 1,500 requests?
**A:** Nothing immediately. You'll get a warning email at 1,200 (80%) and 1,425 (95%). Service only pauses at 1,800 (120%).

### Q: Is Pro really unlimited?
**A:** Yes, under fair use. If you consistently exceed 25,000 requests/month, we may discuss a custom enterprise plan.

### Q: Can I downgrade if I'm not using my quota?
**A:** Yes! Contact support to downgrade. Downgrades take effect next billing cycle.
