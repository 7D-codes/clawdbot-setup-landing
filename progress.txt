## Decisions Made

| Date | Decision |
|------|----------|
| 2026-02-07 | Privacy-first: no monitoring, just metering |

## Notes

- Competitor (emergent.sh) is ephemeral — we win on persistence
- SimpleClaw is just hosting — we win on skills + sub-agents
- Differentiation: Skill marketplace + sub-agent orchestration

Next action: Start CD-002 (Docker image)
